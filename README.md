  <h1 style="border-bottom: none;">Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting</h1>
  <p><em>This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore</em></p>
</div></br>


## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The predictive model is based on historical data of resale flat transactions and will assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.</br></br>


## Skills Takeaway
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building
- Model Deployment
- Domain
- Real Estate</br></br>

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This model will be deployed as a web application, enabling users to input details about a flat and receive an estimated resale price. The predictive model aims to assist potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions by providing an estimated resale value based on historical data.</br></br>

## Motivation
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, with various factors influencing resale prices such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. Accurately estimating the resale value can be challenging. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by developing a predictive model that provides users with an estimated resale price based on key factors.</br></br>

## Scope
The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
    - Collect resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to the present.
    - Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.



2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
    - Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
    - Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests).
    - Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.

5. **Streamlit Web Application**:
    - Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input flat details (town, flat type, storey range, etc.).
    - Utilize the trained machine learning model to predict the resale price based on user inputs.

6. **Deployment on Render**:
    - Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible over the internet.


7. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.</br></br>

## Deliverables
The project will deliver the following:
    - A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
    - A user-friendly web application (built with Streamlit/ Flask / Django) deployed on the Render platform/ Any Cloud Platform.
    - Documentation and instructions for using the application.
    - A project report summarizing the data analysis, model development, and deployment process.</br></br>

## Data Source
The data for this project can be accessed from Singapore Data Gov.</br></br>

## Results
The project aims to benefit both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can use the application to estimate resale prices and make informed decisions, while sellers can get an idea of their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.</br></br>
